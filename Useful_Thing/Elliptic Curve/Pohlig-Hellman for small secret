When the secret d << E.order(), we can use PH for small secret to solve ECDLP, using dlogs and crt:

Code: From ConnorM

primes = [] #prime_factors(E.order()) than choose small primes 
dlogs = []

#A = d * G
for fac in primes:
    t = int(G.order()) // int(fac)
    dlog = (t*G).discrete_log(t*A) 
    dlogs += [dlog]
    print("factor:", str(fac), "done")
d = crt(dlogs, primes)
