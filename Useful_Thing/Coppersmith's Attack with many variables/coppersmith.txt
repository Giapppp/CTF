You should try many implementations, cuz sometimes this one isn't work, but another one will !

rbtree: https://gist.github.com/chrsow/f766786bfcb0034d8c6c9372b822222c (because this was wrote in python2 and sage, so you need to fix it a bit to work in python3)

Coppersmith's Attack with one variable is easy with sage function .small_roots(), but with many variables is a nightmare :D
